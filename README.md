PLP #1MillionDevsInAfrica Hackathon - Portfolio Build


Good day, 
Please see my hackathon submission herein, I trust that there shouldn't be any issues with the repository or otherwise , if so - please contact me , I'll be happy to attend.


You may follow the link (https://plp-hackathon-portfolio.vercel.app/) to see my portfolio - or you may click the link on the right side of the screen in the <i>About</i> section on the repository home page.


I have built my portfolio with HTML5, CSS3 & some external elements like Google for font and Font Awesome for icons. This project was a challenge that I took on with great enthusiasm - I made sure to make use of previous lessons we had on Web Development, and also used a combination of techniques learned through various Youtube channels. 


Best,

Tshimo
